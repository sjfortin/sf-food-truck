# SF Food Truck Finder Web App Project Plan

## Project Goal

Develop a web application that allows users to find food trucks in San Francisco using a CSV dataset.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js App Router build](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). 

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://sf-food-truck.samfort.in/](https://sf-food-truck.samfort.in/). The production site is deployed automatically when a PR is merged into the `main` branch.

The staging site can be accessed at [https://sf-food-truck-staging.samfort.in/](https://sf-food-truck-staging.samfort.in/). The staging site is deployed automatically when a PR is merged into the `develop` branch.
